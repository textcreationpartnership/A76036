            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am glad to heare of your health by your Letter of the ſecond of this moneth. And for the Conſpiracy in Ireland it is ſo certaine, that I can aſſure it unto you by my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the evills, for on Sunday was a ſennight laſt, when it was to have beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted generally throughout the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I was then at my Country houſe ſome 26 miles from Dublin, and ſome murmerings there was of an inſurrection, but privately whiſpered, But at a place called Kells a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Towne within a mile of my houſe, a mighty Concourſe of Papiſts were at Maſſe, which was ſaid that day, for the good ſucceſſe of the Plot, and a pardon to all that ſhould goe boldly on in the Adventure. I was at Church that day in the Towne, (and I praiſe GOD) ſerved him without any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157081:3"/>ſuch feare: but yet recollecting ſome things from all theſe matters of ſuſpition, I ſet a watch in my Towne, and went to bed, and at midnight there was an allarum given, as if the Rebels had beene come to Kells, but it was my owne neighbours of Kells, that were the Rebels indeed. But that intimation needed not make me goe, for my wife and I in that extremity (having eight good gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the ſtable) ſhaked on our cloathes, and ſo many ſervants as we had horſes for within the doores, tooke our flight for our lives, and got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or 12 miles by breake of the day, when all the Towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Kells came to my houſe, and thence drove away ſome 13 hundred faire Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſheepe, two hundred Milch Cowes young and old, ſome worth five pounds, and moſt worth foure pounds a peece, ſome twenty or two and twenty horſes, Mares and Colts, that were abroad young and old, twenty Swine, and as much houſhold-ſtuffe, plate and Iewels, Linnen and ſuch like goods, as was not ſo little worth within doores as Six hundred pounds. And thus in two houres ſpace I was made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157081:3"/>two thouſand pound the worſe in my eſtate. But the ſafety of my wife, and childrens lives, and of my owne, who was eſpecially deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have my throat cut as a leading man, hath ſo ſweetned my croſſe as (I thanke my God) I ſuffer it with much patience and cheerfullneſſe, and ſo doth my wife alſo, and God be praiſed we are all now gotten ſafely to Cheſter, where I beleeve all the Ladies and Gentle-women of Dublin and neare thereabouts are come, that the Towne is full. I meane to place my wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here, till we heare how things will goe, and I purpoſe God willing to be at London with you ere it be long, in the meane time if the party be come, pray tell him I muſt not faile of my monies for my owne ſupply, for I proteſt we eſcaped with the cloathes on our backs and of 500 pound rents now due at all Saints, I feare me, the Kingdome now ſtands in ſuch a condition, as not a penny will be gotten of it. For the plot it was this, that in one day the Caſtle of Dublin and all the Kings forts in Ireland ſhould have beene taken, and all the Proteſtants throats cutt throughout all that Kingdome.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:157081:4"/>
            <p>The Intelligence I received ſince I came away is thus written. viz. The newes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine is that there hath beene a deſigne for the blowing up of Chriſt-Church in Dublin, but by the mercie of God deafeated, and certaine barrels of Gunpouder found under the Church. Divers Rogues have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to fire the Suburbs, but are taken and two Gibbets ſet up for their ſudden executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lieutenant Britteridge though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a Proteſtant hath Combined with the Papiſts in both deſignes and is fuddenly to be hang'd, I am ſurpriſed by the Poaſt who is going or I had written more.</p>
